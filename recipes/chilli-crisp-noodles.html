    <!-- Instructions of how to cook dish -->
    <ol><h4>Instructions</h4>
        <li>Sauce base; Mix the sesame paste, soy, vinegar, sugar, salt and sesame oil until smooth. Use a bowl large enough to toss the noodles because we will be adding the noodles into the sauce. 
            Sprinkle the green onion on top, dont mix it in. We will be pouring hot oil on it so it partially cooks it.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Chilli crisp fry-up; Heat the chilli crisp and oil in a small saucepan over medium high heat. 
            Then add the garlic and ginger and sauté for 30 seconds until golden. Be prepared for amazing smells!</li>
        <br>
        <li>Sizzle! Pour the hot chilli crisp over the green onion and enjoy the sizzle! Mix to mostly combine.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Cook noodles per packet directions. The ramen cakes I use are boiled for 2 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Drag the noodles straight out of the hot water into the bowl. The excess water helps thin the sauce to give the finished dish the right consistency.
             Toss noodles in the sauce until dispersed, adding extra water from the saucepan if needed to loosen the noodles.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Taste and serve! Toss through coriander/cilantro. 
            Add more salt if required, different chilli crisp brands vary in saltiness (most homemade chilli crisp recipes are far less salty). Then devour!</li>
