    <!-- Description of Dish -->
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The best haloumi recipe I know, Haloumi Fries! Think; French fries, but better. The outsides are crunchier (thanks panko!) and the insides are warm, salty haloumi cheese.
         Guaranteed crowd pleaser for a party or as a starter. Fry, bake or air-fry!
    </p>
    <p>Named as such because they look like fries except made with haloumi, Haloumi Fries are not a new thing. 
            They have been on the menu of Mediterranean and plenty of non-Mediterranean restaurants/bars/bistros for years, and there is loads of recipes on the internet.

    <!-- Instructions of how to cook dish -->
    <ol><h4>Instructions</h4>
        <li>Cut the haloumi into sticks around 1.5cm / 0/6″ thick. The length will depend on the shape of your haloumi. I cut mine into 5 slices lengthwise,
         then each into half which makes uniform fries, and get 20 pieces.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Garlic dipping sauce; Probably should have put this first because I do it first! Just mix the ingredients together then set aside while you make the haloumi fries. 
            It needs at least 15 minutes to let the flavours infuse and meld.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Crumbingl; OK, crumbing time! Flour first….then shake off excess.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Then egg, hold it up to let the excess drip off.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Then the panko. Press to adhere well and make sure there is no naked patches!</li>
        <br>
        <li>Fry the halmoui sticks for just 90 seconds until golden and crisp in oil pre-heated to 180°C/350°F.
          <br>
            Oil temperature testing; If you dont have a thermometer, test the oil temp using a small cube of white bread. 
            It should take 15 seconds to turn golden and crispy.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Drain the cooked fries on a paper towel lined tray. Then continue cooking.
          <br>
            Because haloumi fries only take 90 seconds to cook, you dont need to worry about keeping cooked ones warm in the oven.
          <br>    
            Once they are all cooked, serve with the garlic dipping sauce!</li>
